    <h1 class="page_title">About Me</h1>
    <div class="page_content">
        <p>In 2003, I was born in Spain, before my family quickly moved to the east coast of the United States. I grew up in a small town near Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
        <p>We moved to Los Angeles county when I was about 9 years, and I have spent most of my life in a charming sububrban town, surrounded by nature and mountains. I spent a lot of my childhood exploring the mountains and beaches of Southern California, and I have always been fascinated by the natural world.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I was exposed to both arts and film, alongside technology and programming. I have always been interested in the intersection of the two. My family very much is into film, with my brother and father both working in the industry.</p>
        <p>In high school, I tried to balance between enjoying my youth, and trying to progress and learn more about myself. It was unfortunately about March of my junior year when the COVID outbreak started, forcing classes to go online. This had been a very isolating time, which forced me to explore who I am in isolation of others</p>
        <p>I graduated from Santa Monica College with an AS in Computer Programming, and an AA in Social and Behavioral Science and Arts and Humanities. From these, I learned about computer science and programming in Java, C++, HTML/CSS/JS, and MySQL. I also learned about the human condition, the origins of humanity, and the arts<p>
        <p>I since transferred to UC San Diego, where I am learning how to mix a passion for music, with a passion for technology. I'll be learning music theory and electronic composition, alongside audio mixing and mastering, alongside programming in the audio scene.</p>
